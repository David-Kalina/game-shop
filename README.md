# Game Shop 
## **The Project**
### **What**
Game Shop is going to be an e commerce website built using Next.JS and React. The website will be video game themed and be powered by [RAWG](https://rawg.io/apidocs). 

### **Why**
Creating an e commerce list has been on my todo list for a while now. I finally feel ready to take a stab at it. I'll also be trying out a new development workflow that I've been meaning to try. Usually, as a solo developer (that's changed) I iterate and implement without much planning. This process has been great early in my career as I hadn't built much and had many technologies to learn. However, I found that as I improved my skills I still had trouble closing out projects. My codebase would get polluted with unfinished ideas and working within the codebase became a slog. This time around I want to be a better planner. So for this projects I'm going to spend more time upfront planning, developing mockups, defining an MVP, and leveraging GitHub issues and projects. My hope is that I'll be able to develop a codebase that is collaboration friendly and organized.
